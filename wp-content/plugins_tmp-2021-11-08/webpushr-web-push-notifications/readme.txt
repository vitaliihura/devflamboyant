Fastest growing & lightweight plugin for Web Push Notifications. Instantly add browser push notifications to your WordPress & WooCommerce site. Supports all browsers. 

== Description ==

[Webpushr](https://www.webpushr.com) is the new standard in web push notifications. With Webpushr, you can send browser push notifications to your site visitors across all popular browsers. Your visitors receive these notifications even when they are not on your site. It only takes a few minutes to install. Both HTTP & HTTPS WordPress sites are supported.  

Once you have set it up, your site visitors will start seeing opt-in message to receive web push notifications from you. Once they have opted in, you can send them push messages anytime you want. 

You can configure the plugin to automatically send push notification to your subscribers any time you publish a new post. You can also also view your subscriber count and useful user reports (such as browser & device type), right from the plugin.

Webpushr offers best-in-class support for WooCommerce sites. You can configure it to automatically send Web Push Notification based alerts for new products, price drops, sales promotions & abandoned carts.

Webpushr also offers advanced features such as user segmentation, advanced user analytics & customizable opt-in prompts from [Webpushr Web Console](https://app.webpushr.com/login). 

Webpushr's free plan (a generous limit of 10,000 users) offers all plugin features such as dashboard views, subscriber logs, notification stats and automatically triggered push notifications (anytime you publish a post) for completely free. Contact support@webpushr.com if you have any questions. We are here to help and answer most queries during the same business day.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am currently using a different plugin to enable web push notifications on my site. How can I move my subscribers from my current plugin to Webpushr? =
After you have successfully integrated Webpushr to your site, your previously subscribed users from the old web push service provider (such as OneSignal, etc.) will be automatically re-subscribed to Webpushr once they return to your site. Your previously subscribed users will NOT see opt-in prompt during re-subscription - it will happen silently & automatically.

= Is Webpushr really free?  =
Webpushr is completely free for up to 10000 (10K) active subscribers. No credit card or any form of payment method is required as long as your total number of active subscribers remain less than 10000 (10K).

= Do you offer any custom prompt types?  =
Webpushr offers a variety of custom prompt types. You can customize text, color, logo and behavior on a variety of custom prompt types. 
 

= Will Webpushr sell my data to advertisers or any third party companies?  =
Your trust is the most important thing to us and we NEVER have and NEVER will sell any data for any reason what so ever. Our goal is to be the world's best and most trusted platform for web push notifications.
