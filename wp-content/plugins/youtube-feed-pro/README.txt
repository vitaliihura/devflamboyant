= Setting up the Free Feeds for YouTube Pro WordPress Plugin =

The Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin is brand new and so we're currently working on improving our documentation for it. If you have an issue or question please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin click on the "Feeds for YouTube Pro" item in your WordPress menu

2) Click on the large blue YouTube login button to get your YouTube Access Token and YouTube Refresh Token. Note; if you have your own YouTube Developer Project set up then you can enter your YouTube API key by enabling the checkbox below the YouTube login button.

3) Authorize the Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin to read data about your YouTube videos and YouTube channel.

4) YouTube sends back your YouTube Access Token and YouTube Refresh Token which are then automatically saved by the Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin. This information is required in order to connect to the YouTube API.

5) Enter a YouTube channel name to display videos from.

6) Navigate to the Customize and Style pages to customize your YouTube feed.

7) Once you've customized your YouTube feed, click on the "Display Your Feed" tab for directions on how to display your YouTube feed (or multiple YouTube feeds).

8) Copy the [youtube-feed] shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the YouTube feed to appear.

9) You can paste the [youtube-feed] shortcode directly into your page editor.

10) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your Feeds for YouTube Pro in a sidebar or other widget area.

11) View your website to see your YouTube feed(s) in all their glory!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple YouTube feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple YouTube feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: `[youtube-feed channel="smashballoon" num=3]`.

= How do I embed a YouTube gallery directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your YouTube gallery directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[youtube-feed]'); ?>`.

= Will Feeds for YouTube Pro work with W3 Total Cache or other caching plugins? =

The Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin should work in compatibility with most, if not all, caching plugins, but you may need to tweak the settings in order to allow the YouTube feed to update successfully and display your latest posts.  If you are experiencing problems with your YouTube feed not updating then try disabling either 'Page Caching' or 'Object Caching' in W3 Total Cache (or any other similar caching plugin) to see whether that fixes the problem and the YouTube feed displays and updates successfully.
