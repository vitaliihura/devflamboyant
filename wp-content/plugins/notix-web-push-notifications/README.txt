Notix provides custom solutions for any kind and size of business. If you have less than 30,000 subscribers Notix is free for you for good. Please check all plans here [https://notix.co/pricing](https://notix.co/pricing)

* **Monetization**
You can monetize your push subscribers upon request along with sending your own content in notifications. Feature is voluntary, please get in touch with our team in order to turn it on.

* **API Integration**
You can use Notix as it is, or WP plugin, or Notix' SAAS for developers. In any case, you can get all opportunities from Notix engine.

* **Working with databases of any size**
You can work with databases of any size and the service is suitable for individual and corporate clients.

* **Geo-Targeting**
Geo triggered push notifications allow a business to send information to clients using data obtained from their current or previous locations in order that they can deliver the most appropriate message to the appropriate user.
For example, the geolocation feature from NOTIX is perfect for informing customers about nearby promotions or events, recommended stores and restaurants, or sending them health and weather alerts. Targeting by city is also available.

* **Device Targeting**
Targeting specific devices is another excellent feature that makes NOTIX a good choice. The user consents in the web-page to receive in-page and on-device alerts. Both desktop and mobile alerts depend on the device’s subscription type.
This feature enables users to send push notifications to mobile devices with already identified installation IDs who have opted to receive messages. It is always done by consent so there is no potential for misuse.
As noted, there is also the ability to send desktop notifications that will reach users in their browser. This is a great way to stay top of mind and increase engagement with users.

* **Campaign Segmentation**
NOTIX uses several criteria to segment push notifications, such as browser language, region or geographic indicators, subscription period (or specific date), platform, and browser type.

* **Automation options**
In Notix you can build chains of automated push notifications, by creating repeated messages, scheduled messages, and also by using RSS feeds. You can either connect Notix to your Zapier or Integromat account for working with RSS feed, or you can just paste it in our dashboard without using 3rd party technologies.

* **Analytics**
With NOTIX analytics feature, you can easily identify push notifications with high read rates, identify the most engaging, and notifications with high click-through-rates. With such information, you can refine your push notification messaging accordingly.
